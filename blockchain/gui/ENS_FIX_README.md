# ENS Error Fix and Blockchain Connection Tools

This document explains the fixes made to address the "network does not support ENS" errors and provides guidance on using the various testing tools.

## What Was Fixed

1. **ENS Lookup Errors**: 
   - Ethers.js v6.x tries to perform ENS (Ethereum Name Service) lookups by default, which causes errors with Ganache.
   - All provider instances now include `ensAddress: null` to disable ENS lookups.

2. **Contract Address Updated**:
   - Changed to use the Hardhat default contract address: `0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3`
   - This is the address that gets assigned to the first deployed contract when using Hardhat.

3. **Account/Signer Handling**:
   - Updated signer creation to use the Hardhat default private key: 
   - `0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80`
   - This ensures we connect to the first account correctly.

4. **Error Diagnostics**:
   - Added better error messages and debugging information
   - Created enhanced testing tools to diagnose connection issues

## Testing Tools Available

### 1. simple-tester.html
A minimal tool for testing basic connection to Ganache and contract interaction.
- Tests ethers.js loading
- Tests connection to Ganache
- Tests account access
- Tests basic contract functions

### 2. enhanced-tester.html
A more comprehensive tool with better UI and diagnostics.
- Tests connection with both localhost and 127.0.0.1
- Shows detailed account information
- Tests contract owner and function access
- Provides better error reporting

### 3. contract-verifier.html
A tool specifically for verifying contract deployment and functions.
- Checks if contract exists at a given address
- Verifies key contract functions
- Displays helpful contract information

## How to Test Your Connection

Follow these steps to ensure everything is working correctly:

1. **Start Ganache**:
   ```
   ganache --port 7545 --deterministic
   ```

2. **Deploy the Contract** (if not already deployed):
   ```
   npx hardhat run --network ganache scripts/deploy.js
   ```

3. **Open one of the testing tools** in your browser:
   - `simple-tester.html` for basic tests
   - `enhanced-tester.html` for more detailed diagnostics
   - `contract-verifier.html` to verify contract functions

4. **Verify Contract Address**:
   - The default contract address is set to `0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3`
   - This is the standard address for the first contract deployed with Hardhat
   - If your contract is at a different address, update it in the testing tools

5. **Check Connection**:
   - Click "Test Connection" or similar button in the tool
   - If successful, you should see a success message with the current block number

6. **Check Account Access**:
   - Click "Get Accounts" to verify account access
   - You should see a list of accounts with their balances

7. **Test Contract Functions**:
   - Click "Test Contract" or similar to verify basic contract functions
   - If successful, you should see the contract owner and other details

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check Network Connection**:
   - Make sure Ganache is running on port 7545
   - Try both "localhost" and "127.0.0.1" as the host

2. **Verify Contract Address**:
   - Make sure the contract address is correct
   - Confirm the contract is deployed to Ganache

3. **Check Console**:
   - Open browser developer tools (F12)
   - Look at the console for detailed error messages

4. **Contract Functions**:
   - If basic connection works but contract functions fail, check the ABI
   - Make sure the contract is deployed with the expected functions

5. **Private Key**:
   - If using your own account, make sure to update the private key
   - The default key is for the first Hardhat account

## Ongoing Use

After verifying that the connection works:

1. Open `index.html` to use the main application
2. The connection fixes have been applied to all tools
3. The contract address is saved in localStorage for convenience
4. Use the "Set Contract Address" button if you deploy a new contract
