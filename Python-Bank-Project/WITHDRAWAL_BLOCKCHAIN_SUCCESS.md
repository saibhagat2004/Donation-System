# 🎉 WITHDRAWAL BLOCKCHAIN INTEGRATION - COMPLETE SUCCESS! 

## ✅ **PROBLEM SOLVED**

**Issue**: Withdrawal transactions were not appearing in the blockchain UI's "Outgoing" tab
**Root Cause**: Withdrawals were being recorded as "donations" instead of "spending" transactions
**Solution**: Updated withdrawal logic to use `recordSpending()` function for proper categorization

## 🔧 **Technical Fix Applied**

### 1. **Updated Contract ABI** 
- Fixed Python `blockchain_integration.py` to match the deployed smart contract ABI
- Added missing `recordSpending` function definition
- Added missing `owner` function for permission checks

### 2. **Modified Withdrawal Logic**
- **Before**: `blockchain.record_donation_on_blockchain()` → Appeared in "Incoming" tab
- **After**: `blockchain.record_spending_on_blockchain()` → Appears in "Outgoing" tab

### 3. **Permission Verification**
- ✅ Confirmed our account (`0x35b6cdc6F2a0990d38d232eEe6007846B531d5a0`) is the contract owner
- ✅ Has permission to call `recordSpending()` function
