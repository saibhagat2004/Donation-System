Blockchain Development Workflow: Step-by-Step Order
Here's the recommended order of operations for developing your blockchain component:

1. Write and Test Your Smart Contract
Start with your smart contract as it's the foundation:

Write your Donation.sol contract with proper functions for recording donations and spending
Test it thoroughly using Hardhat's testing framework
This ensures your core functionality works before connecting other components
2. Install and Configure Ganache
Set up your local blockchain environment:

Install Ganache: npm install -g ganache
Start it with persistence: ganache --database.dbPath ./ganache-db
This gives you a stable environment for development and testing
3. Update Your Deployment Scripts
Prepare your deployment process:

Update your deploy.js script to work with current Hardhat
Add code to save deployment information (address, ABI)
Test deployment to your local Ganache instance
4. Create the Integration Layer
Build the bridge between your app and blockchain:

Write your ethers.js integration service
Create the necessary API endpoints
Test that you can successfully record transactions on the blockchain
5. Connect Your Banking System
Finally, connect your Python banking app:

Add HTTP requests to your backend API
Store transaction hashes alongside your banking records
Test the entire flow end-to-end
